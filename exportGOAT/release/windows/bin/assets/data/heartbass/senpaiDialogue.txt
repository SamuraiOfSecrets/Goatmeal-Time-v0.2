:goat:You ready to get smacked down?
:jer:How can I get smacked down if you're taller than me? If anything I'm smacking YOU down!
:goatsmirk:Not entirely false, but don't try to be smarter than me with your 2 IQ brain.
:jeroops:Ouch. I'm hurt.
:goatsmirk:Too harsh? I'm sorry.
:goat:Let's get to singing and move past the smack talk. We're here to have fun, after all!
:jer:It's alright I can take whatever you can dish out, whether it be trash talk or bars.
:goatsmirk:Then bring it, squirt.
:jermad:DON'T CALL ME SQUIRT!
